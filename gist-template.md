You can find descriptions of a specific regex, that looks like a hexadecimal in this README. A letter and a whole number value system is used for hexadecimals.

## Summary

The REGEX found in this intinerary will be explaining a matching email expression. We will deconstruct this following statement : /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/. 

Ensure that user creates an email address that starts with an arbitrary amount of characters before the @ symbol, followed by a domain, each element of this regex has a specific duty.
